sparkplug coin blockchain network

Want to take part in a nerdy community experiment? Start mining and staking SPARKPLUG COINS (PLGZ) right from your laptop, computer or virtual desktop. We are now offering (unsupported) SPARKPLUG CHAIN wallets that can access the sparks.network. For your taking part in securing and maintaining our PoW/PoS hybrid private blockchain from your desktop or laptop, (mining and staking with your wallet) you will receive the (PLGZ) Coin. This is NOT an ethereum token or stable coin. This is a true Crypto that is the reward for mining each block on the network.

Since this is a new blockchain, the difficulty is truly low. This blockchain starts with PoW (Proof of Work) mining function and will eventually move to an entirely PoS (Proof of Stake) directly, natively and almost automatically in your SPARKSCHAIN wallet.

Current functionality includes our Blockchain Nodes and the Crypto wallets. The PLGZ coins are ready for use as soon as they are confirmed on chain. 21-23 transactions after mining.

Rewards for mining are:

500 PLGZ BLOCK MINING REWARD

50 PLGZ STAKING REWARD

THE IDEA

We want to build a blockchain that will do so much more than simply have a crypto currency like Bitcoin, Dogecoin or Litecoin. We want to build something that will be able to function with smart contracts, have Defi platforms and other apps functioning with it and on it. We also knew that over time, PoW has a bad reputation due to its effect on infrastructure and power consumption as well as the environment both direct and indirect. However, if we start with a model where everything runs on only one to two servers and everyone else who gets in must buy in and “stake,” that really centralizes things more and it makes it easy for the big guys to jump in and do well, but the little guy cannot afford to get in. As we have developed on many blockchains that are this model, we realized that it would be incredibly hard for newbies and normal joes to take part since the cost of a stake for some of the nodes on these kinds of blockchains cost thousands of dollars just to start and others, the hardware cost to build a miner is too high.

So, we have built a system that is starting on WINDOWS desktops and moving to MAC OS, LINUX OS, virtual desktops, Raspberry Pi and more. Not only that, buy starting this way with ASIC resistence, we are allowing the little guy in crypto to start with us and grow with us. And from the moment you have enough in your HODL, you will automatically become a “STAKER,” and receive rewards like the big guys.

In essence, we leave the dance with the ones we came with. Yep, the goal is to see you, the brand new crypto enthusiast get rewarded for helping us grow more and more decentralized and then from there, who knows… Maybe you will find yourself teaming up with us for more!
